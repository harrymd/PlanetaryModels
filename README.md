This repository provides MATLAB scripts for generating a planet model on a tetrahedal mesh as well as it reference gravity field. 


If you only need to build a tetrahedal mesh, please compile tetgen. 

Just go to ./tetgen1.5.0 and type make. 

If you need to compute the reference gravity field, please go to ./package/stfmmlib3d-1.2, and compile it. 

If you use a linux node, you may follow the README.md under ./package
